hi,
I'm struggling to use localhost certificates made with mkcert.dev and Chrome webtransport.

I'm trying to rewrite in Go, the Python server code from: https://github.com/googlechrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/webtransport

But I can't even make it work with Python:

The errors I get :
Chrome devtool:
  Failed to establish a connection to https://localhost:4433/counter: net::ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR.QUIC_TLS_CERTIFICATE_UNKNOWN (TLS handshake failure (ENCRYPTION_HANDSHAKE) 46: certificate unknown).
Python server terminal:
  Connection close received (code 0x12E, reason 199:TLS handshake failure (ENCRYPTION_HANDSHAKE) 46: certificate unknown)

The certificate is made with mkcert from a locally installed CA (mkcert --install) which is installed in the OS and so available with Chrome.
The certificate is for 'localhost', 127.0.0.1 and ::1
It works fine with https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/blob/master/example/main.go and Chrome (v103) without any certificate warning.

The same certificate works fine with Python aioquic example (server + client) but not with Chrome too...

tl;dr:
localhost certificate is ok with Chrome with python or go servers directly over http3/quic
but not over webtransport with same servers ?!

any idea what I did wrong. What is different beetween http3 and webtransport regarding certificates ?

code used:
client: 
https://localhost:4433/counter = code from https://github.com/googlechrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/webtransport for both client and server
